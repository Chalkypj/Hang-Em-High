# HANG EM HIGH
---
## A hangman game written in python 3.11.5 on Windows 10 using the pygame library. This is my first ever game using pygame and I based it on the YouTube tutorial from Tim Ruscica, which can be found at https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-ndZlN21DasvpfKwIc1rI6w.

#### To run - install the dependencies found in the *requirements.txt* file, then open a terminal in the *Hang-Em-High* directory and enter *python.exe main.py*.

#### Play the game using the mouse, where the aim is to guess the word before the man is hanged.
